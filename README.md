# Pediatric Cancer - Spatial distribution of Incidence 
# Detection of Spatial High Risk Clusters 


# To run the Simulation Study for the manuscript "Statistical Methods for Spatial Cluster Detection in Childhood Cancer Incidence: a Simulation Study"
# --> File "Code Spacial Cluster Childhood Cancer" is needed to run the simulation and get raw data (simulated relative risks and test for clustering)
# --> File "Cluster" is needed for the population data to run the simulation
# --> GADM Files Germany are needed for the Spatial Polygon Maps
