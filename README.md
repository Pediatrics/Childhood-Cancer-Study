# Pediatric Cancer - Spatial distribution of Incidence 
# Detection of Spatial High Risk Clusters 


# To run the Simulation Study for the Cancer Epidemiology manuscript "Statistical Methods for Spatial Cluster Detection in Childhood Cancer Incidence: a Simulation Study" and to reproduce the datased for the Data in Brief manuscript "Analyzed Data of Simulated Nephroblastoma Cases"
# File "Code Spacial Cluster Childhood Cancer" is needed to run the simulation and get raw data (simulated relative risks and test for clustering)
# File "Cluster" is needed for the population data to run the simulation
# GADM Files Germany are needed for the Spatial Polygon Maps

# Simulation as presented here (for test runs) runs in about 1 minute. Resulting files: A) Results from the Cluster detection tests ("xxxxRESULTS.xlsx") B)  Raw data from the simulation ("xxxxSIMULATEDDATA.Rdata")
